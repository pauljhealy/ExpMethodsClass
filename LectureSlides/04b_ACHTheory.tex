\begin{frame}{Savage's Hot Man Example}
Pay All: ``Suppose, for example, that a hot man actually prefers a swim, a shower, and a glass of beer, in that order. Once he decides on, and thereby becomes entitled to, the swim, he can no longer appropriately be asked to decide between shower and beer... [because he would be] deciding between a swim and shower... and a swim and a beer.''

\br
Pay One Randomly: ``W. Allen Wallis has mentioned to me an interesting an very general device... (I have since seen this same device used by M. Allais.) Suppose that the hot man is instructed to rank the three acts in order, subject to the consideration that two of them wil be drawn at random... and that he is then to have whichever of those two acts he has assigned a lower rank.''   

\br
Early uses: Allais (1953), Yaari (1965)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Savage's Hot Man Example}
Savage says this requires two things:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The hot man thinks each pair is drawn with positive probability
    \item Hot man's preferences over $\{f,g\}$ are the same as over $\{f,g,h\}$
\end{enumerate}

\br

But it creates a lottery... what about preferences over lotteries?

\br

Later authors: expected utility is required

Paying for both decisions creates a hedging problem:

Truth: \$2 if right, \$0 if wrong\\
Hedge: \$1 for sure

    \item Decision 1: $L$ vs. \$1 for sure
    \item Decision 2: $L$ vs. \$2 for sure

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Suppose $\$2\succ L \succ \$1$
    \item Picking $\{L,\$2\}$ gives lottery $(0.25,\$0;0.5,\$2;0.25,\$3)$ (TRUTH)
    \item Picking $\{\$1,\$2\}$ gives lottery $(0.5,\$1;0.5,\$2)$ (LIE)
    \item $\exists$ RDU preferences where $\$2\succ L \succ \$1$ and LIE $\succ$ TRUTH

  $$
        U(x_1,p_1;\ldots;x_n,p_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n u(x_i) \left[ w(\sum_{j=1}^i p_j) - w(\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} p_j)\right]

Preference reversal literature:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lichtenstein \& Slovic (1971): binary choice \& WTP, inconsistent
    \item Grether \& Plott (1979): more careful design \& BDM incentives
    \begin{itemize}
        \item State valuation $\$m$
        \item Random dollar amount $\$d$ is drawn
        \item Get item if $d<m$
        \item Get $\$d$ if $d\geq m$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Karni \& Safra:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Write out the two-stage lottery
    \item Assume rank-dependent utility (non-EU)
    $$
    U(x_1,p_1;\ldots;x_n,p_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n u(x_i) \left[ w(\sum_{j=1}^i p_j) - w(\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} p_j)\right]
    $$
    \item Finds an example where $A\succ B$ but announce $v(A)<v(B)$ in BDM
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Karni \& Safra (1987)}
    \textbf{Theorem:} There are never any preference reversals in any such experiment if and only if preferences satisfy expected utility

    \br

    Following this paper, many authors believed ``RPS is incentive compatible if and only if people satisfy EU''

    \br

    \textbf{Unseen problem:} Karni \& Safra (1987) implicitly assumed ROCL.\\And CompIND + ROCL $\Rightarrow$ MixIND\\
    So is it MixIND or CompIND that's needed?

    \br

    Some authors were on the right track (Harrison \& Swarthout 2014, e.g.) but necessary and sufficient conditions for RPS were still unclear.

    \br

    As of 2011, things weren't nailed down

  \frametitle{Goals of Azrieli et al. 2018}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe an abstract model of experiment

    \item Define a notion of incentive compatibility of the payment mechanism (``each decision is made as if in isolation'')

    \item Understand under what conditions the RPS mechanism is incentive compatible (answer: `monotonicity')

    \item Characterize the set of incentive compatible payment mechanisms (assuming monotonicity)

    \item Perform 3 \& 4 for the Pay All mechanism as well

  \end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{An Abstract Model of Experiment}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $X$: A finite set of `objects' (no structure).
    \item $D=(D_1,\ldots,D_k)$: A finite list of decision problems, where each $D_i\subseteq X$. Assume $D_i\neq D_j$ and $|D_i|>1$ for every $i$ (can be easily relaxed).
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\succsim$ over $X$ (complete \& transitive)
    \item For any $E\subseteq X$ define $\max(E|\succsim)=\{x\in E:(\forall y\in E)\ x\succsim y\}$
    \item Shorthand notation: $\mu_i(\succsim) = \max(D_i|\succsim)$
    \item $\mu(\succsim) = \times_i \mu_i(\succsim)$ (`optimal choices in isolation')
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
      \item Messages: $M=\times_i D_i$ (`announced choice')
      \item Payment mechanism: Maps $M$ to `payments'

  %Hypothesis: Dictator game giving correlates with risk preferences.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item First decision: dictator game\\
    $D_1 = \{(\$100,\$0),(\$99,\$1),\ldots,(\$0,\$100)\}$. $m_1 = (\$90,\$10)$
    \item Next: 5-question Holt-Laury elicitation\\

\begin{frame}{Two-Stage Lotteries}
Like Karni \& Safra, we need to analyze preferences over two-stage lotteries
\begin{itemize}
    \item Preferences we're studying ($\succsim$) are over $X$
    \item ``Payment objects'' are different! $\mathcal{P}(X)\neq X$ (unless $k=1$)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Random choice of what's paid $\Rightarrow$ $\mathcal{P}(X)=\Delta(X)$ (lotteries or acts)
        \item Pay all: $\mathcal{P}(X)=2^X$ (bundles from $X$)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Need to extend $\succsim$ to $\mathcal{P}(X)$
    \item Call this $\succsim^*$
    \item Incentive compatibility \textit{must} be an analysis of $\succsim^*$, not $\succsim$
\end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Payments: Acts vs Lotteries}

The researcher may use a randomization device (say, roll a die) to determine which element of $X$ is chosen for payment

\bigskip

Two possible approaches regarding how the subject views this uncertainty:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Savage (1954): Payment based on a die roll is an \emph{act}\\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Finite state space $\Omega=\{\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_n\}$
    \item A payment $f(\omega)\in X$ for each $\omega\in \Omega$
    \item The set of all acts is $\mathcal{F}=X^\Omega$. So $\mathcal{P}(X)\subseteq X^\Omega$
    \item Each $m\in M$ is mapped to some act $\phi(m)\in \mathcal{F}$
  \end{itemize}

\bigskip

\item Payment based on a die roll is an \emph{objective lottery}\\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\Delta(X)$ -- the set of lotteries on $X$. So $\mathcal{P}(X)\subseteq \Delta(X)$
    \item Each $m\in M$ is mapped to some lottery $\varphi(m)\in \Delta(X)$
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{IC Experiments vs. IC Mechanisms}
How does this differ from classical mechanism design?
\br
Mechanism Design:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Trying to implement a particular SCF/SCC
    \item IC is only important because IC $\iff$ implementable
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We don't really \textit{care} about truth-telling \textit{per se}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Often, weak IC is fine
    \item Usually use deterministic mechanisms
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Exceptions: Gibbard (1977), Barbera (1977)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\br
IC Experiments:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Don't directly care what outcomes are paid (SCF/SCC)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item (Except budget considerations, etc.)
    \end{itemize}
    \item IC is important b/c we want to observe true $\succsim$!
    \item We will demand strict IC to ensure $\succsim$ is observed
    \item Need to rely on random mechanisms

%``Incentive compatibility is never free''


\begin{proposition}
If no restrictions are placed on $\mathcal{E}(\succsim)$ (other than consistency), then there is an IC payment mechanism if and only if there is only one decision problem ($k=1$).

  \frametitle{Other IC Mechanisms?}

Maintaining the monotonicity assumption ($\mathcal{E}= \mathcal{E}^\mathrm{mon}$), what is the class of all incentive compatible mechanisms?

\bigskip

\textbf{From now on, assume only strict $\succsim$ are admissible:}
\begin{itemize}
\item A unique maximal element in each decision problem\\($\mu(\succsim)$ is a singleton).
\item There may be $m\in M$ that cannot be rationalized:\\
    $D_1=\{x,y\}$, $D_2=\{y,z\}$, $D_3=\{x,z\}$\\
    $m=(x,y,z)$ is not \emph{rationalizable}\\
    \smallskip

    $M_R$=rationalizable messages\\
    $M_{NR}$=non-rationalizable messages
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Surely Identified Sets}
\textbf{Example:}
$D_1=\{x,y\}$, $D_2=\{y,z\}$, $D_3=\{x,z\}$. Consider $E = \{x,y,z\}$\\
If $m\in M_R$, then we know your favorite thing in $E$.\\

\begin{definition}
A set $E\subseteq X$ is surely identified if, for every $\succsim$, the choices $m=\mu(\succsim)$ reveal the $\succsim$-maximal element of $E$, denoted $\max(E|m)$. Let $SI(D)$ be the family of surely identified sets for $D$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
$$E\in SI(D) \Leftrightarrow \forall x,y\in E~~ \exists D_i^{x,y}\in D,~~ \{x,y\} \subseteq D_i^{x,y}\subseteq E$$
\end{lemma}

(Recall example above. $D_i^{x,y}=D_1$, $D_i^{y,z}=D_2$, $D_i^{x,z}=D_3$)

\textbf{Proof Sketch:} Suppose $x_0$ is $\succsim$-maximal in $E$ (but this isn't known). For any $y\in E$, $x_0$ is chosen from $D_i^{x_0,y}$. That data will prove that $x_0\succsim y$ for all $y\in E$. Thus, choices from $D$ reveal that $x_0$ is $\succsim$-maximal


In practice, usually not much overlap in $D_i$ sets.\\
In that case, $SI(D)=\{D_i\}_{i=1}^k \bigcup \{x\}_{x\in X}$.

  \frametitle{RSS Mechanisms}
  Given $\phi$, denote $P^\phi(\omega)=\{\phi(m)(\omega)\}_{m\in M}$.\\
  Things you could get paid in state $\omega$ as you vary $m$\\
  In RPS, $P^\phi(\omega_i) = D_i$

  \bigskip

\begin{definition}
    $\phi$ is a Random Set Selection (RSS) Mechanism if, for each $\omega\in \Omega$, $P^\phi(\omega)\in SI(D)$ and for every $m\in M_R$,
    $$
        \phi(m)(\omega) = \max (P^\phi(\omega) | m).
    $$
\end{definition}
 \bigskip


  Interpretation: I roll a die and pay you either for a real decision you made, or for a fake decision where I can \emph{always} figure out what you would have chosen. Note: RPS $\subset$ RSS

  \bigskip

  \emph{One} known example of RSS that's not RPS : Krajbich (2011)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Characterization}
\begin{theorem}
     $(D,\phi)$ is incentive compatible w.r.t. $\mathcal{E}^\mathrm{mon}$ if and only if
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $\phi$ is an RSS mechanism;
      \item Each $D_i$ is surely identified by the sets $\{P^\phi(\omega)\}_{\omega\in\Omega}$;
      \item $m\in M_{NR}$ implies $\phi(m)\not\in \phi(M_R)$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\bigskip

Idea of Proof:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item At each $\omega$ you get the revealed-best possible element\\ $\phi(m)(\omega)=\max(P^\phi(\omega)|m)$; thus, RSS
 \item Each $D_i$ matters for the outcome
 \item Non-rationalizable messages give you something from each payment set (by definition), but it shouldn't your favorite in all sets.
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Almost-Characterizing RPS}
  Usually $SI(D) = \{D_i\}_{i=1}^k \bigcup \{x\}_{x\in X}$.\\
  (For example, if each $D_i$ is disjoint.)

  \bigskip

  In this case, RSS = RPS + ``singleton payments''\\
  Like a random show-up fee paid instead of a chosen object\\
  Example: $\Omega=\{\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_6,\omega_7\}$\\
  $\phi(m)(\omega_i)=m_i$ if $i\leq 6$\\
  $\phi(m)(\omega_7)=\$10$

  \bigskip

  Thus, in practice, IC $\iff$ RPS + singleton payments

\begin{definition}
A mechanism $\varphi:M\rightarrow\Delta(X)$ is a \emph{weighted set-selection (WSS) mechanism} if there exists some $\lambda:SI(D)\rightarrow\RR$ such that for every rationalizable $m\in M_R$ and every $x\in X$,
$$\varphi(m)(x) = \sum_{\left\{E\in SI(D)~:~\max (E | m)=x\right\}} \lambda(E).$$

\only<2>{
How to differentiate $\succ^x$ and $\succ^y$?\\
Need $x$ vs. $y$, which is given by $D_1$ or $E_1$. ``Switch test sets'' for $\{x,y\}$\\
Thus, $\lambda^1$ is not IC because $\lambda^1(D_1)=\lambda^1(E_1)=0$\\
$\lambda^2$ (RPS) and $\lambda^3$ are IC\\
$\varphi^3(\succ^x)(x)=1/2$ (from $E_1+D_2$) $>$ $\varphi^3(\succ^x)(y)=1/4$ (from $D_3$)\\
$\varphi^3(\succ^y)(y)=1/2$ (from $E_1+D_3$) $>$ $\varphi^3(\succ^y)(x)=1/4$ (from $D_2$)
}
\only<3>{
Don't even need $\lambda(E_1)$ to be positive! See $\lambda^4$:\\
$\lambda^4$ is still IC for $\succ^x$ and $\succ^y$ since:
\begin{align*}
\varphi^4(\mu(\succ^x))(x)=\underbrace{\lambda^4(D_1)}_{1/2}+\underbrace{\lambda^4(E_1)}_{-1/4}+\underbrace{\lambda^4(D_2)}_{1/4}>\underbrace{\lambda^4(D_3)}_{1/4}=\varphi^4(\mu(\succ^x))(y)\\
\varphi^4(\mu(\succ^y))(y)=\overbrace{\lambda^4(D_1)}+\overbrace{\lambda^4(E_1)}+\overbrace{\lambda^4(D_3)}>\overbrace{\lambda^4(D_2)}=\varphi^4(\mu(\succ^y))(x)
\end{align*}
}
\only<4>{
  But we don't need switch test sets for \textit{all} $\{x,y\}$ pairs.\\
  Note $\mu(\succ^a)=\mu(\succ^b)$ since $\{a,b\}$ are not in any SI sets together\\
  \textit{This experiment isn't designed to distinguish $a\succ b$ vs. $b\succ a$!}\\
  We only need weight on switch test set $E$ for $\{x,y\}$ if $\{x,y\}\subseteq E\in SI(D)$

Tentative necessary condition:\\
For every $x,y\in X$ it holds that
$$\sum_{ \{E\in SI(D)~:~ \{x,y\}\subseteq E\} } \lambda(E) > 0$$
}
\only<6>{
But wait... we may need to distinguish things not at the top of $\succ$\\
Suppose $z$ is added to the top of both $\succ^x$ and $\succ^y$\\
Consider $E_3=\{x,y,z,a\}$. Now $E_3$ isn't a helpful switch test set!\\
Both would pick $z$\\
Need to require that $E\subseteq \{a,b,c,x,y\}$ so that $z\not\in E$

\begin{definition}
A WSS mechanism $\varphi$ (with associated weighting vector $\lambda$) satisfies \emph{switch positivity} if, for every $x,y\in X$ and $A\subseteq X\setminus\{x,y\}$ it holds that
$$\sum_{ \{E\in SI(D)~:~ \{x,y\}\subseteq E\subseteq A\cup\{x,y\}\} } \lambda(E) > 0$$
(provided the sum is not empty).

Here, $A$ is the stuff ranked lower than $x$ and $y$ for some possible pair $\succ^x$ and $\succ^y$

\bigskip
\bigskip

There is a normalized and convex `capacity' $v:2^{\{x,y,z\}} \rightarrow [0,1]$ that `represents' $\varphi$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\varphi(\mu(\succsim))(a_1) &=& v(a_1,a_2,a_3)-v(a_2,a_3)\\
\varphi(\mu(\succsim))(a_2) &=& v(a_2,a_3)-v(a_3)\\
\varphi(\mu(\succsim))(a_3) &=& v(a_3)
\end{eqnarray*}
$\{a_1,a_2,a_3\}=\{x,y,z\}$ and $\succsim$ ranks $a_1\succsim a_2 \succsim a_3$.


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{`Proof' (cont.)}

%$D_1=\{x,y\},~ D_2=\{x,z\},~ D_3=\{y,z\}$
%
%\bigskip
%\bigskip

Each $v$ can be represented uniquely by the `unanimity capacities':
$$v(A) = \sum_{E\subseteq A} \lambda (E)$$


\begin{eqnarray*}
\varphi(\mu(\succsim))(a_1) &=& v(a_1,a_2,a_3)-v(a_2,a_3) = \sum_{a_1\in E} \lambda(E)\\
\varphi(\mu(\succsim))(a_2) &=& v(a_2,a_3)-v(a_3) = \sum_{a_2\in E\subseteq \{a_2,a_3\}} \lambda(E)\\
\varphi(\mu(\succsim))(a_3) &=& v(a_3) = \sum_{E\subseteq \{a_3\}} \lambda(E)
\end{eqnarray*}

But this is exactly the required representation...

\begin{proposition}
If $\phi$ is an IC act-mechanism (defined on some state space $\Omega$), and $\mu$ is a full-support probability distribution on $\Omega$, then the lotteries-mechanism $\varphi$ generated by $((\Omega ,\mu), \phi)$ is IC.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
Assume that $\varphi$ is an IC lotteries-mechanism.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the associated weighting vector $\lambda$ of $\varphi$ is non-negative, then there exists an IC acts-mechanism $\phi$ (on some $\Omega$) and a probability $\mu$ on $\Omega$ such that $((\Omega, \mu), \phi)$ generates $\varphi$ on rationalizable messages.

\item If the associated weighting vector $\lambda$ of $\varphi$ contains negative elements, then $\varphi$ cannot be generated by any IC acts-mechanism $\phi$ (even when restricted to rationalizable messages).

    \item If RPS, need to assume monotonicity. Weak, unless 2-stage gambles.
    \begin{itemize}

    \item Other mechanisms may be IC for certain models.
    \item \textbf{Experimenter needs to decide for themselves!}
  \end{itemize}

  My (current) opinion:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Use RPS
    \item Separate decisions as much as possible.
    \item Use separate, physical randomizing devices.

  Other Monotonicity Violations:

    \item Irrational Diversification (NCaT also violated)
    \item Repeated decision problems (randomization)
    \item List format (Brown-Healy)

  Issues Besides IC:

%  Either:
%  \begin{enumerate}
%    \item Reduction is satisfied and lower-stage independence fails\\
%          (Thus, monotonicity fails)
%    \item Reduction is not satisfied and monotonicity still fails
%    \item $\succsim$ depends on $D$
%  \end{enumerate}

%  None of these are great news.

%  For $\Delta(X)$ ($X$ has no structure), we have a characterization.\\

%  Recall: RPS = pay for 1 random problem\\
%  Our results:
%  \begin{enumerate}
%    \item RPS is IC if preferences are monotonic, EU, Prob. Sophisticated,...
%    \item If \emph{all} monotonic prefs admissible, RPS is essentially the \emph{only} IC mech
%    \begin{itemize}
%      \item Can pay using SI sets, but those seem rare in practice
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item If you \emph{must} pay for multiple decisions, assume NCaT
%    \item If you don't believe in monotonicity, only have 1 decision
%  \end{enumerate}
%
%  Warnings:
%  \begin{itemize}
%    \item Monotonicity can still be violated
%    \item Don't have too many decisions
%    \item Make sure a single `decision' is properly defined
%  \end{itemize}
